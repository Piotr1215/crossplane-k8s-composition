What makes Crossplane so special? First, it builds on Kubernetes and capitalizes on the fact that the real power of Kubernetes is its powerful API model and control plane logic (control loops). It also moves away from Infrastructure as Code to Infrastructure as Data. The difference is that IaC means writing code to describe how the provisioning should happen, whereas IaD means writing pure data files (in the case of Kubernetes YAML) and submitting them to the control component (in the case of Kubernetes an operator) to encapsulate and execute the provisioning logic.

The best part about Crossplane is that it seamlessly enables collaboration between Application Teams and Platform Teams, by leveraging [Kubernetes Control](https://containerjournal.com/kubeconcnc/kubernetes-true-superpower-is-its-control-plane/) Plane as the convergence point where everyone meets.

## Kubernetes Simplified

Production grade Kubernetes resources are often complex chunks of YAML with settings related to security, performance, hardware utilization, observability and the list goes on. Below you can see an example of a deployment with hardened security settings and other best practices.

![Complex deployment](_media/complex-deployment.png)

And this is just a single deployment resource, there are many more to worry about. Typically, a containerized app running on Kubernetes will require

- deployment
- service
- service account
- roles and cluster roles
- role bindings
- secret
- config map
- network policies
- HPA (horizontal pod autoscaler)

And those are only stateless workflows, for stateful workloads, very often

- volumes
- persistant volume claim
- storage class configuraiton
- stateful sets

And because Kubernetes almost never funcions in isolation, you will need to inclulde multiple CRDs (custom resource definitions) that come along with additonal products like service meshes, observability tech, security scanners and many many more.

Here is a list of Kubernetes resources commonly used to describe workloads. The items marked with * are the ones where developers typally have to interact with.

![K8s Resources](_media/k8s-resources.png)

Now imagine that those resources will need to be multiplied by the number of applications/teams/environments and each is likely to have a slight variation to account for differences in the team governance, tech stack, changes velocity etc.

There are 2 common approaches to solving this problem.

1. Make a handover point bewteen Dev and Ops be a container image. In this scenario developers don't have any influence on how resoiurces are put together and what configuraiton is used. On the other hand Ops do not have development and application know how and context to properly address development concerts. Result? Silos with increasingly complicated and convoluted handoff procedures, no clear separation of concerns, leading to development slowing down and new features being released less frequent.
2. Shift left without support. Developers are left to theri own devices and prioritize application develooment concerns over operational concenrs.

Correct way TODO

By utilizing [Kubernetes provider](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-kubernetes), it's possible to control what Kubernetes resources are being created. It also enables complexity hiding for developers not familiar with [Kubernetes Resource Model](https://github.com/Kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/architecture/resource-management.md). In this scenario we will deploy a Kubernetes application consisting of:

- deployment
- service
- horizontal pod autoscaler

Instead of exposing the resources directly to developers who might be inexperience with Kubernetes, we will create a simple composition containing only important fields, such as:

- namespace to deploy to
- image with tag

First we need to let Crossplane know that we would like to define a composite resource (XR), by creating a composite resource definition (XRD) `kubectl apply -f definition.yaml`. Next let's create a sample composition to let Crossplane know what resources should be created `kubectl apply -f composition.yaml`.

> Definition describes API for creating a composite resource whereas composition defines what managed resources will be created when composite resource is created either directly or by a dedicated claim.

Here are the resources created in our cluster. `kubectl get xrd` shows our composite resource definition whereas `kubectl get compositions` returns all available compositions. Give it a try.

We need to create a namespace for the resources `kubectl create ns devops-team` first.

Our composition and definition describes what Kubernetes objects we want to create, but how should developers let us know what should be created? Do they need to open a Jira ticket? ðŸ˜¤... Nah, they just need to create a simple claim, like so

```yaml
apiVersion: acmeplatform.com/v1alpha1
kind: AppClaim
metadata:
  name: platform-demo
  labels:
    app-owner: piotrzan
spec:
  id: acmeplatform
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      type: frontend
  parameters:
    namespace: devops-team
    image: piotrzan/nginx-demo:green
```

By applying the claim, we are creating multiple Kubernetes resources "under the hood" without needing to know what they are and how they are created. This concern can be moved onto a Platform Team.

`kubectl apply -f app-claim.yaml`

`kubectl wait deployment.apps/acmeplatform --namespace devops-team --for condition=AVAILABLE=True --timeout 1m`

There are several resources created based on the composition `kubectl get managed`. One of them is a deployment with a sample web app, let's port forward to it.

`kubectl port-forward deployment/acmeplatform -n devops-team --address 0.0.0.0  8080:80`

You can also [open the web page right here](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)

In the next section, we will see how easy it is to modify the claim âž¡

We can easily update the image

`kubectl apply -f app-claim-blue.yaml`{{execute interrupt}}

> Notice how the page changed background color to blue with just one line change

`kubectl port-forward deployment/acmeplatform -n devops-team --address 0.0.0.0  8080:80`

> You can [open the web page right here again](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)

Deleting the application and underlying resources is as simple as `kubectl delete -f app-claim.yaml`{{execute interrupt}}
You observe how all the resources created by the claim got deleted as well

The similicity was possible thanks to Crossplane's composition mechanism which we will explore later.

## The Power of Composition

The magic of crossplane really happens in the [composition](https://crossplane.io/docs/v1.6/reference/composition.html). There are 3 main tasks that composition performs

- compose together set of managed resources based on a claim or composed resource
- reference credentials needed for accessing the provider API
- patch/map from values provided in a claim to values in managed resource

Below you can see how composition creates deployment, service and horizontal pod autoscaler in response to creating the AppClaim. The "binding glue" between the composition and actual Kubernetes resource is a composite resource definition (XRD) which you can think of as a kind of API between the developer consuming resources via claim and platform engineer or SRE desgning the composition for underlying resources or infrastructure.

Here are 2 key fields that make the composition so powerful.

### forProvider

Specifies kubernetes resources and settings to be created. In this case we can see how the composition adds livenessProbe and readinessProbe as well as resource limits which might be defined by the Platform Team and thus not exposed to Application Development Teams.

### Patches

Enables mapping between fields provided in the definition (XRD) and fields in the Managed Resource (MR).

> The blow YAMl is abbreviated and the complexity of those files can be substantial. This is by design, there is no magic "remove complexity" button. Instead Crossplane provides facilities for moving the complexity onto the Platfrom Teams and designing simple, custom APIs for other teams.
